# agora-web-broadcast-demo
An easy implementation of multi channel broadcast using single project ID of [Agora.io](https://www.agora.io) [Web SDK](https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/API%20Reference/web/index.html). This code implements a "one to many" live broadcasting web-app similar to Facebook, and Youtube Live. The web-app will allow a single broadcaster to stream their video feed to a multi-person audience. This project can be extended to support "many to many" broadcasting, where multiple broadcasters are streaming to the same audience. All available channel can be viewed in a table fetched from firebase.
